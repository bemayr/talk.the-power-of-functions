> Materials for my talk about Getters and Setters, how to reason about functions and why purity makes things so much easier.

## Used VS Code Plugins
Because some people asked me after the talk which plugins I use: [Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) and [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner).
You can get the relative line numbers using `editor.lineNumbers: "relative"` and this is mainly used for easier navigation using the vi bindings.

## Slides
The slides are available under [`./slides`](./slides).
